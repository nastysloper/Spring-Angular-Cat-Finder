SUPERCATS!

Toy app to learn Spring MVC and Angular.
The app began life as a monolith, and then was 
broken into a front end and backend application.

The frontend is called SuperCatsFrontEnd and 
runs on port 8085.

This module is the backend and runs on port 8080
at localhost:8080/super_cats_war_exploded.
